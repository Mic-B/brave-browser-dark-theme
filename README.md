# Brave Browser Simple Dark Theme

This is a complete fork of the [Brave Browser](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop) for macOS, Windows, and Linux. I straight up copied this joint just to give it a quick dark theme. Seriously, that's the only reason. 

If you want to take this dark theme further, feel free to make a pull request. If it doesn't look ridiculous, I'll accept it. And frankly, I'm sure it does look ridiculous -- I've only tested this on macOS Sierra. Because that's all I'll use it on.

All of the changes are in 1 file (~/less/window.less) to keep things concise, and *yes* I used important flags because reasons. 

See my full write-up [here](https://mic-b.com/words/how-to-use-brave-browser-with-a-dark-theme) to get things going. Enjoy!
