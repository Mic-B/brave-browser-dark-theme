# Brave Browser Simple Dark Theme

This is a complete fork of the [Brave Browser](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop) for macOS, Windows, and Linux. I straight up copied this joint just to give it a quick dark theme. Seriously, that's the only reason. 

If you want to take this dark theme further, feel free to make a pull request. If it doesn't look ridiculous, I'll accept it. 

All of the changes are in 1 file (window.less) to keep things concise and yes I used important flags because reasons.
